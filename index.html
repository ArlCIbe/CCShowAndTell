    <p>Last week, I learned about control flow in Javascript. This included "if... else" statements, switch statements and loops. I also learned about operators and deepeened my understanding of functions.</p>

    <ul>

        <li><button onclick="alert('I do not know what I do not know.')">javascript verbage</button></li>
        <!--Although I can usually parse out what the code is saying, I can't actaully name what's on my screen. I am a verbal processor, so this is problematic because if I can't explain something, I don't understand it.-->

        <li><button onclick="alert()">script from scratch</button></li>
        <!--Again, I can understand the code and DJ when he's instructing (usually), but I can't reproduce it on my own.-->

        <li><button onclick="alert()">CSS layout</button></li>
        <!--Anything to do with the display properties quickly getsd out of hand.-->
    </ul>
